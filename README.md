# Stealer-

Created via Batch Scripting although it's a basic Script but its functionalities are awesome, it is created as a test for data theft,

How it Works: You need a pendrive, and you need to set this script as an autorun for pendrive (For autorun you can go for various Free software) And After that when you will plug your pendrive in someone's computer, it will copy data of his "users" folders, which contains photos and videos of the victim machine.

Additionally it also steals data such as

. System information 
. Software Installed
. Serial Number 
. Wifi Devices In Range
. Wifi Adapter Info
. Macaddress of NICs
etc

Firstly you need to, input your Pendrive Mountpoint letter into this script so that data can be copied there

Also it floods Cdrive with large Amount of empty directories. That can be little bit like a nightmare for the owner, as the system can become unstable 

Guys Still it's a Basic virus like Script. I need to learn more

If you use it for Malicious purposes, I will not be responsible. 
Thankyou !!
